# Network Policy

Control outbound network access for a Cube Sandbox. Three modes are set at
creation time — fully air-gapped, CIDR allowlist, CIDR denylist — and a fourth
example changes the policy of a sandbox that is already running.

## 1. Background

**Cube Sandbox** is a lightweight MicroVM platform compatible with the
[E2B SDK](https://e2b.dev). Network policies are enforced at the **Cubelet tap
network layer** — before packets leave the VM — so they cannot be bypassed from
inside the sandbox.

```
Sandbox VM
    │  outbound packet
    ▼
Cubelet tap network layer  ◄── policy applied here
    │  allowed
    ▼
Public internet / internal network
```

## 2. Policy Modes

### Mode 1 — No Internet (`network_no_internet.py`)

All outbound traffic is blocked. Use this for code execution and data-processing
tasks that have no legitimate need for external network access.

```python
Sandbox.create(
    template=template_id,
    allow_internet_access=False,
)
```

### Mode 2 — Allowlist (`network_allowlist.py`)

Only traffic to the specified CIDR ranges is allowed; everything else is dropped.
Use this when the sandbox needs to reach specific internal services and must not
reach any other destination.

```python
Sandbox.create(
    template=template_id,
    allow_internet_access=False,
    network={
        "allow_out": ["10.0.0.53/32", "10.0.1.0/24"],
    },
)
```

### Mode 3 — Denylist (`network_denylist.py`)

Full internet access is allowed, but traffic to the specified CIDR ranges is
blocked. Use this to block cloud-provider metadata endpoints or sensitive
internal subnets while keeping general internet access intact.

```python
Sandbox.create(
    template=template_id,
    allow_internet_access=True,
    network={
        "deny_out": ["169.254.0.0/16", "10.0.0.0/8"],
    },
)
```

### Mode 4 — Update a running sandbox (`network_dynamic_update.py`)

Replace the egress policy of a sandbox that is already running, without losing
its filesystem or process state. Use this when an agent must be granted a
destination partway through a task, or must lose one as soon as a step finishes.

```python
sandbox.update_network(
    network={"allow_out": ["8.8.8.8/32"], "allow_internet_access": False}
)
```

It takes the whole policy as one object, `allow_internet_access` included,
matching E2B's `update_network`. `Sandbox.create` keeps that flag as a separate
argument because E2B's create does the same — the asymmetry is upstream's, and
following it is what lets code written against either SDK work unchanged.

Two things set this apart from the create-time modes:

- **It is a replacement, not a patch.** A key you leave out is cleared, so
  `sandbox.update_network(network={"allow_internet_access": False})` revokes
  everything.
- **It reaches connections that are already open.** A connection the new policy
  no longer permits is reset, rather than surviving until the peer closes it.
  This is what makes revocation take effect rather than merely apply to future
  connections.

This is a CubeSandbox extension, so the example uses the `cubesandbox` SDK
(`sandbox.updateNetwork(...)` in Node, `sandbox.UpdateNetwork(...)` in Go).

To confirm an update landed, read the policy back with
`sandbox.get_network()` (`getNetwork()` in Node, `GetNetwork(ctx)` in Go). It
answers from the node the sandbox runs on, and its `generation` advances on
every accepted update, so it distinguishes "my policy is live" from "my request
was accepted and something else changed it since".

The script walks four scenarios, in order: an IP allow list, a live connection
carried across a revoking update, a domain allow list, and switching on L7
interception mid-run. Unlike E2B — where `network.rules` is create-only — L7
rules can be changed on a running sandbox.

## 3. Policy Summary

| Mode | `allow_internet_access` | `network` key | Effect |
|------|------------------------|---------------|--------|
| No internet | `False` | _(none)_ | All outbound traffic blocked |
| Allowlist | `False` | `allow_out` | Only listed CIDRs reachable |
| Denylist | `True` | `deny_out` | Listed CIDRs blocked, rest allowed |
| Dynamic update | either | any of the above | Replaces the policy of a running sandbox, resetting connections it no longer permits |

## 4. Prerequisites

- A running Cube Sandbox deployment
- Python 3.8+

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 5. Quick Start

### Step 1 — Create a Template

```bash
cubemastercli tpl create-from-image \
  --image cube-sandbox-int.tencentcloudcr.com/cube-sandbox/sandbox-code:latest \
  --writable-layer-size 1G \
  --expose-port 49999 \
  --expose-port 49983 \
  --probe 49999
```

> **Image registry:** Use `cube-sandbox-int.tencentcloudcr.com` (international)
> or `cube-sandbox-cn.tencentcloudcr.com` (mainland China).

Note the `template_id` printed on success.

### Step 2 — Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and fill in E2B_API_URL and CUBE_TEMPLATE_ID
```

Or export directly:

```bash
export E2B_API_KEY=e2b_000000
export E2B_API_URL=http://<your-node-ip>:3000
export CUBE_TEMPLATE_ID=<template-id>
```

### Step 3 — Run an Example

```bash
# Fully air-gapped sandbox
python network_no_internet.py

# Allowlist: only specific CIDRs are reachable
python network_allowlist.py

# Denylist: block specific CIDRs, allow everything else
python network_denylist.py

# Grant, then revoke, a destination on a running sandbox
python network_dynamic_update.py
```

Expected output for `network_no_internet.py`:

```
internet access blocked: True
isolated execution ok
```

Expected output for `network_denylist.py`:

```
public internet: 200
metadata endpoint blocked: True
denylist network ok
```

## 6. How It Works

Cube Sandbox translates the `network` parameter into a `CubeVSContext` struct
that is passed to Cubelet when the VM is created:

| SDK parameter | Cubelet field | Enforcement |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| `allow_internet_access=False` | `AllowInternetAccess=false` | Drop all public-IP traffic |
| `network.allow_out` | `AllowOut` (CIDR list) | Forward only matching destinations |
| `network.deny_out` | `DenyOut` (CIDR list) | Drop matching destinations |
| `update_network(...)` | `UpdateNetworkPolicy` | Converge the live policy maps, then re-evaluate established connections |
| `get_network()` | `GetSandboxNetwork` | Read the installed policy and its generation back from the node |

All enforcement happens in the tap network device of the KVM MicroVM, so
policies are applied at the kernel level and cannot be bypassed from inside
the sandbox.

## 7. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Sandbox cannot reach expected address | Wrong CIDR in allowlist | Verify the CIDR covers the target IP |
| Metadata endpoint still reachable | CIDR not in denylist | Add `169.254.0.0/16` to `deny_out` |
| `Template not found` | Wrong template ID | Run `cubemastercli tpl list` |
| `Connection refused` | CubeAPI not reachable | Check `E2B_API_URL` and port 3000 |
| `update_network` returns 409 | Sandbox is paused or already gone | Resume it first; a paused sandbox has no live policy to update |
| Update succeeded but a domain stopped resolving | Every domain was dropped from the policy, which also withdraws the implicit DNS-resolver allowance | Keep at least one domain target, or add the resolver IP to `allow_out` |
